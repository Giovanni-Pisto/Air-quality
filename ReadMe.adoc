# Air Quality Project

## Project Description.
The Air Quality project aims to monitor air quality using Arduino and a series of sensors. The goal is to collect data on major air components, such as the presence of pollutant gases and suspended particles, in order to assess the overall quality of the surrounding environment.

## Project components.
The project makes use of the following components and sensors:

1. Arduino Nano 33 IoT: An open-source electronic prototyping platform that is used as the basis for the project.
2. Additional sensors:
   - CCS811 Adafruit: A gas sensor that detects the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air.
   - PMS 5003: A suspended particle sensor in PM2.5 and PM10, which measures the amount of fine particles in the air.
   - Multichannel Gas Sensor from Groove Seed: A sensor that detects the presence of various pollutant gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3) and benzene (C6H6).
   - Temperature sensor DHT11: A sensor that measures ambient temperature and humidity.

## Programming language.
The Air Quality project is implemented using the C/C++ programming language with the Arduino IDE.

## Arduino Cloud and thingProperties.h file.
Arduino Cloud is a cloud-based platform that provides a web interface to monitor and control Arduino devices. In the context of the Air Quality project, Arduino Cloud can be used to view data collected from sensors and control any associated actions.

The file "thingProperties.h" contains the variables to be used in the Arduino Cloud web interface to monitor the sensors and display the corresponding data. This file defines the device properties that are to be registered on the platform. The included variables can be customized to the project specifications.

## Gerber file for PCB creation.
For those who wish to create their own PCB for the Air Quality project, a Gerber file is available. Gerber files contain the information needed for PCB production. Using the Gerber file, you can send the data to a PCB manufacturer to get your own custom printed circuit board.

## Repository contents.
The project repository contains the following files:

- `AirQuality.ino`: The main Arduino code file that handles reading sensors and sending data to Arduino Cloud.
- `thingProperties.h`: The file that defines device variables and properties for the Arduino Cloud web interface.
- `Gerber.zip`: The ZIP archive containing the Gerber file for creating the PCB.

## Installation and usage guide.
To install and use the Air Quality project, follow the following steps:

1. Connect the sensors to the Arduino device according to the connection diagram provided.
2. Open the `AirQuality.ino` file with the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino device.
4. Modify the `thingProperties.h` file to fit the specifications of your project and the Arduino Cloud web interface.
5. Configure and register the device on Arduino Cloud following the instructions provided by the platform.
6. Use the Arduino Cloud web interface to monitor the sensors and visualize the collected data.
